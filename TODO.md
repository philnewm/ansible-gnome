# Ansible Gnome TODOs

## Short Term

* Implement wayland on/off switch
* Enhance background images to only download a list of needed ones

## Long Term

* Develop abstract structure to work for more general use cases
* any kinds of customizations like settings and extensions should be optional 
* integrate packer pipeline to rebuild development images after every new release
